# Java-Public Module

## Overview
This repository contains a collection of Java source files and sample programs for learning, practicing, and demonstrating core Java programming concepts. It is organized for use in coursework, self-study, and experimentation with Java syntax, algorithms, and problem-solving techniques.

## Structure
- **Root Directory**: Contains individual Java files covering topics such as loops, arrays, randomization, string manipulation, and basic algorithms (e.g., `ForLoop01.java`, `ArrayDoubleValues.java`, `RandomCompliment.java`).
- **CSC-115/**: Contains coursework and exercises for the CSC-115 class, with similar Java files and additional practice problems.
- **BubbleSort/**, **CB/**, **CBJavaSource/**, **chap14/**: Subfolders for specific topics, chapters, or projects, each with relevant Java source files and supporting materials.

## Key Topics Covered
- Control structures: for, while, and do-while loops
- Arrays and array manipulation
- Random number generation and simple games
- String operations and formatting
- Basic algorithms (sorting, guessing games, etc.)
- Simple user input/output
