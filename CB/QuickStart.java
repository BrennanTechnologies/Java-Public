	Run the program
		- To run the program, press F5. By default, the program is launched in the Integrated Terminal. You should already see the output there.

	How to Debug?
		- When you press F5, you are already debugging. Try setting some breakpoint by clicking on the line numbers before each code line and run the program again. You'll see the execution paused at the breakpoint.
	
		- While debugging, switch to the Debug View to see the variables and call stacks.
